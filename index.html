                        <p class="paragraph">
                            This is my most recent front-end (soon to be backend) project. I used many libraries and frameworks such as jquery,chart.js,vue.js,bootstrap, css grids, and more. In this project I sought out to incorporate popular elements seen in many websites such as dynamic searching, json request for APIs, and dynamically graphing information. At the moment only a front-end version exists but I am using <span style = "color:green;">Django</span> to try and create a sign up system for users and work on my knowledge of the MVC framework.

                        <p class="paragraph">
                          Much of the source code for this website was derived/inspired by what was taught in the udemy advanced css/sass course linked below. Learning responsive, modern design is my greatest priority at the moment as it not only makes my websites look better but allows for functionality for different devices.

                        <p class="paragraph">
                            I use Unity and C# to create games. This is the first Unity game I released on google play and revolves around defending your castle using spells and mercenaries. I casually create games right now but the gaming industry is a definite field of interest after I graduate university.

                               In order to bring my websites to life I learned Django to work on the backend. In doing so I learned a great deal of Python. I am yet to release my Django project as it is not completed to the level that I would like.

                                I have programmed in Java longer than any other language. I feel the most confident with Java when it comes to Data Structures and Algorithms as it is the primary language of my school.On my own I learned platforms such as JavaFX.
